### **EDA Data visualization**

EDA Data visualization. Exploring and Preparing Data.  <br> 
Perform exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering using Pandas and Matplotlib Exploratory Data Analysis. <br>
Preparing Data Feature Engineering<br>
In this assignment, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
